```

This will start the server and make it accessible at port 8021.

### To start webapp for Admin tasks like adding a form or adding a catchment etc...

REACT_APP_DEV_ENV_USER=admin@ayu yarn start
```

### Pull requests

### File/folder structure

- Folders per route/feature
  (See https://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html)
- Reducers and actions in 'ducks' structure (See https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)

### Code Style

- We use Prettier for javascript/jsx formatting. You can use your IDE/Editor specific Plugin to format code using Prettier. Alternatively there is also a command `yarn prettier-all` that will format all files in src folder using Prettier. And there also is a git precommit hook that formats staged files using prettier before commiting.

### Continuous Integration

All commits are built and tested and deployed to staging if tests succeed. Build status can be seen at https://circleci.com/gh/OpenCHS/openchs-webapp. Please run tests using `yarn test` before you push your code so you don't end up breaking things unnecessarily.
